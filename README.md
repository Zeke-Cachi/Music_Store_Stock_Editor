## Fake Music Store Stock Editor

## FullStack WebApp

This site allows you to connect to a CRUD server (also made by me) and see or modify the items in the database.

## Stack

For this project, I used MongoDB as the main database. For the backend I used Node.js with Express. Finally, for the frontend I used Next.js, along with Tailwind, although most of the visual components like buttons or
menus were made using DaisyUI).

## Observations

There were a couple of routes from the server that I ended up not using (like search by ID), since i created a simple ID system in the frontend, so it doesn´t display the mongoDB-created Id.
